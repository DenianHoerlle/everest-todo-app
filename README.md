# My TODO App Challenge

My take on the TODO app take home assignment made by Everest.

# How its made

## Main tools:
### React(canary version - 19.3.0-canary-1324e1bb-20251016)
Switched to canary version to access experimental `<ViewTransition />` component;

### Vite
Ultra fast build tool used that greatly improves dev experience.

### Tailwindcss
Using CSS for the versatile customization and the standardization it incentivizes

### Zustand
Zustand is the choosen tool for the global state. It offers unopinionated and very light implementation.

## Running the app

### Run `yarn install`

### Run `yarn start`

Runs on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) by default.

### Be sure to check out `references.md` to understand key decisions made during development!
